                    highlights the iconic Old Well at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The
                    surrounding trees are mostly bare, and the campus is under a cloudy sky. Recently,
                    the Old Well has been updated with a new sloped pathway, which replaced the
                    previous temporary ramp. This improvement, completed in late 2021, enhances
                    accessibility for individuals with physical disabilities, allowing them to participate in the
                    cherished tradition of drinking from the Old Well. This renovation aligns with UNC’s
                    commitment to inclusivity while preserving the Old Well's significance as a symbol of
