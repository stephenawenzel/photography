            </div>

            <h2 class="col-9 col-sm-8 col-xl-4">Starting Out</h2>
            <article id="starting_img" class="about_img"></article>
            <p class="col-12 col-sm-12">Growing up in the serene surroundings of Clyde, North Carolina, just a stone's throw from the Blue Ridge Parkway, I discovered my passion for photography at 15. It all started when a Northern Flicker, a vibrant species of bird, perched on my windowsill, allowing me to see its intricate details clearly. This moment sparked a deep curiosity to explore the natural world through my lens, much like Joel Sartore’s Photo Ark project, which documents 16,000 animals. As I wandered the parkway, capturing the beauty of animals and landscapes, I realized that photography was more than just a hobby—it was a calling.</p>
            
            <h2 class="col-9 col-sm-8 col-xl-4">Folkmoot</h2>
            <article id="folkmoot" class="about_img"></article>
            <p class="col-12 col-sm-12">My love for portrait photography blossomed during my time volunteering with the Folkmoot International Dance Festival in Waynesville, North Carolina. The diversity and talent of the dancers I photographed captivated me, driving me to continue volunteering and capturing their stories for three consecutive years, photographing dancers representing more than 15 countries. This experience deepened my understanding of photography as a powerful tool to showcase the essence of individuals and their unique journeys.</p>
            
            <h2 class="col-9 col-sm-8 col-xl-4" style="color: #62C6F2; border-color: #62C6F2;">UNC Chapel Hill</h2>
            <article id="uncchapelhill" class="about_img"></article>
            <p class="col-12 col-sm-12">While pursuing a biology degree at UNC Chapel Hill, I took a transformative elective photography course under the guidance of Peter Hoffman through the UNC Hussman School of Journalism & Media, and Jeffrey Camarati, the Director of Photography for UNC Athletics. The class, alongside my talented classmates like Tristan Brown and Elliot Millner, opened my eyes to the limitless possibilities of photography, teaching me to master equipment I never imagined using. This knowledge has enabled me to capture images that go beyond the ordinary, focusing on the talents and passions that drive people to excel.</p>
            
            <h2 class="col-9 col-sm-8 col-xl-4">Honing In</h2>
            <article id="honingin" class="about_img"></article>
            <p class="col-12 col-sm-12">Throughout college, I honed my craft by taking on portrait and senior photography projects, always seeking creative side quests to push the boundaries of my skills. From experimenting with light painting and shutter drag techniques to creating striking visual narratives, my work stands out for its emphasis on collaboration. I believe that the best photographs are born from a shared vision, which is why I work closely with my clients before and during each shoot to ensure their ideas come to life.</p>
            
            <h2 class="col-9 col-sm-8 col-xl-4">Community</h2>
            <article id="community" class="about_img"></article>
            <p class="col-12 col-sm-12">Volunteering has also played a significant role in my journey. I’ve taught photography to my local Boy Scout Troop 370, where I became an Eagle Scout, sharing my passion with the next generation of photographers. Additionally, I’ve served as the lead photographer and videographer for the Tuscola High School Marching Band, where I developed a new interest in videography.</p>
            
            <h2 class="col-9 col-sm-8 col-xl-4">Hobbies</h2>
            <article id="hobbies" class="about_img"></article>
            <p class="col-12 col-sm-12">Beyond photography, I am deeply connected to my community, always looking for ways to contribute my skills to enhance the lives of those around me. When I’m not behind the camera, you can find me hiking along the Blue Ridge Parkway, trying new foods (like the daring Extra Hot Sandwich with ghost pepper at Rocky’s Chicken Shack), or spending quality time with my energetic Aussie doodle, Denver. I am also an avid National Park explorer, with over 50 national park sites in my National Passport. My favorite ones so far are the Blue Ridge Parkway, naturally, and Red Rock Canyon near Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
            
            <h2 class="col-9 col-sm-8 col-xl-4">Let's Connect <span style="color: #e8b130">!</span></h2>
            <article id="letsconnect" class="about_img"></article>
            <p class="col-12 col-sm-12">I invite you to explore my work on Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest, where I regularly share my latest projects, ideas, and trips. My motto—Community, Collaboration, Creativity—guides everything I do, and I strive to embody these principles in every session. Whether you’re looking for a traditional portrait or a creative collaboration, I’m here to help bring your vision to life.</p>
            
            <h2 class="col-9 col-sm-8 col-xl-4" style="margin: 0;">828 <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> 919</h2>
            <p class="col-12 col-sm-12">Currently based in Durham, North Carolina, I’m available for photography sessions within the area and am periodically in Western North Carolina near Asheville, especially in the summer. If you’re interested in working together, please reach out or schedule a session directly on my main page. I look forward to creating something beautiful with you.</p>
